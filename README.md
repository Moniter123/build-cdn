## About the CDN

The CDN is a collection of machines that receive requests based on latency via Amazon Route53. The theory behind it is
described in [this blog post](https://pasztor.at/blog/building-your-own-cdn). The CDN is deployed
[using Ansible](_ansible/cdn.yml).

Each node is running three servers: traefik to handle SSL and forward requests, nginx to serve the actual content and
PHP-FPM to handle PHP requests. These nodes are run in separate Docker contaienrs using
[docker-compose](_docker/docker-compose.yml).

Content is [deployed using rsync](.deploy.sh) after it is generated by Jekyll.
