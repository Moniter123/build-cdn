# About me

> **Notice to recruiters:** I know, your job is hard, so let's respect each others time: I am working as a freelancer,
> and I am not looking for a job. I am also not going to help your candidate get a job. There is no sense in trying to
> contact me about either issue, or to enter my details into your company's database for later use. I don't
> work with recruiters off the internet.
