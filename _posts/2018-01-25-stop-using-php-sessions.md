OK, that title may be a little provocative, but PHP sessions have a fatal flaw that make them problematic with
modern-day web applications. Let's take a look.

## How do PHP sessions work?

Here's how the web works: your browser sends a request to a server, gets a response and that's it. The server has the
most extreme case of Alzheimer you have ever seen. The next time you send a request, it is not going to know who you
are and what you did literally seconds ago. Just logged in? Who are you again?

Every HTTP request is treated as completely separate, and as strange as that may sound, that is a good thing. It enables
HTTP to be scaled over dozens, or even thousands of servers. After all, your browser doesn't have to know which Google
server it just talked to, right? Why would it need to?

However, there's a problem. Even something as simple as a login system requires the server to know who you are. It
needs to have *state* that is associated with you, the user.

That's what **sessions** are for. Let's take a look how these work:

<figure>{% plantuml %}
@startuml
actor Browser
control Server
database Database
Browser -> Server: Log me in please, here are my creds
Activate Server
Server -> Database: Store new session asdfasdf
Activate Database
Server <-- Database
Deactivate Database
Server --> Browser: OK, here you go, next time you come please send me the cookie PHPSESSID=asdfasdf
Deactivate Server
...
Browser -> Server: Give me this protected resource, PHPSESSID=asdfasdf
Activate Server
Server -> Database: Retrieve session asdfasdf
Activate Database
Server <-- Database
Deactivate Database
Server -> Database: Retrieve sensitive data
Activate Database
Server <-- Database
Deactivate Database
Browser <-- Server: Here you go
Deactivate Server

{% endplantuml %}</figure>

Now, the cookie in this context is not a fancy Christmas treat, but a tiny piece of information stored in the browser.
Once set, the browser sends this tiny piece of information to the server that originally set it.

As you may notice, this gives us an excellent vehicle to identify the user. Now, we don't just *trust* the data in the
cookie, we have to verify it against the database. No funny business here.

## The problem with (PHP) sessions

Now, this sounds quite sensible, right? Let's take a look at how
[PHP does sessions](http://php.net/manual/en/book.session.php) in a bit more detail. At their simplest, PHP sessions
can be used like this:

```php
<?php

session_start();

$_SESSION['thing'] =
  'see you next request';
```

```php
<?php

session_start();

//Outputs 'see you next request'
//if called after the first script
echo($_SESSION['thing']);
```

What you basically have is a giant bag. This bag will travel with the user as long as they come to the site within
the lifetime of the session. Normally, as a sane developer you would do this:

```php
<?php

//after login

$_SESSION['currentuser'] =
  $user;
```

This would enable you to retrieve the current user on any page you are on. Convenient, right? Ok, cool, we have this
wonderful tool, let's put more stuff in it. How about information what the user viewed last? And maybe their language
choice? Oh, damn, caching is too hard, let's put the translations in there...

Yeah. That's usually how sessions end up looking in PHP application. Everyone abuses it to store everything under the
sun because it is terribly *convenient*. But that's not the worst, not by a long shot.

## Race conditions!

OK, so now you have developed your wonderful web application, with Angular, React and what not. It works perfectly 
on your developer machine, it is time to deploy. To deploy, your sysadmin installs a cluster, you switch the sessions
to be stored in MongoDB (because you want to be with the cool kids on the block), and traffic starts to pour in.

Suddenly you notice something *strange*. Things start to break, and you have no idea why. When trying to reproduce the
error on your dev machine, you can't. On the production system it clearly breaks... what happened?

Let's roll back to your dev machine. Here's what happens for a single request:

<figure>{% plantuml %}
@startuml
skinparam ParticipantPadding 20
actor Browser
control PHP1
database Filesystem
Browser -> PHP1: Hey, give me that resource please! PHPSESSID=asdfasdf
Activate PHP1
PHP1 -> Filesystem: Lock session file 'asdfasdf'
Activate Filesystem
PHP1 <-- Filesystem: Here you go
Deactivate Filesystem
PHP1 -> Filesystem: Load contents of session file 'asdfasdf'
Activate Filesystem
PHP1 <-- Filesystem: Here you go
Deactivate Filesystem
... PHP1 does other things to generate response, and when it's finished: ...
PHP1 -> Filesystem: Store contents of session file 'asdfasdf'
Activate Filesystem
PHP1 <-- Filesystem: OK, done
Deactivate Filesystem
PHP1 -> Filesystem: Release lock on session file 'asdfasdf'
Activate Filesystem
PHP1 <-- Filesystem: OK, done
Deactivate Filesystem
Browser <-- PHP1: Here's your content.
@enduml
{% endplantuml %}</figure>

That's all good, but what happens when your frontend developer fires two requests in quick succession? Let's take a
look:

<figure>{% plantuml %}
@startuml
actor Browser
control PHP1
control PHP2
database Filesystem
Browser -> PHP1: Hey, give me that resource please! PHPSESSID=asdfasdf
Activate PHP1
PHP1 -> Filesystem: Lock session file 'asdfasdf'
Activate Filesystem
PHP1 <-- Filesystem: Here you go
Deactivate Filesystem
Browser -> PHP2: Hey, give me that other resource please! PHPSESSID=asdfasdf
Activate PHP2
PHP2 -> Filesystem: Lock session file asdfasdf
note right: PHP2 now has to wait for the lock
Activate Filesystem
Deactivate PHP2
... PHP1 does other things to generate response, and when it's finished: ...
PHP1 -> Filesystem: Release lock on session file 'asdfasdf'
Activate Filesystem
PHP1 <-- Filesystem: OK, done
Deactivate Filesystem
Browser <-- PHP1: Here's your content.
Deactivate PHP1
PHP2 <-- Filesystem: Here you go
note right: PHP2 is now free to continue
Deactivate Filesystem
Activate PHP2
... PHP2 does other things to generate response, and when it's finished: ...
PHP2 -> Filesystem: Release lock on session file 'asdfasdf'
Activate Filesystem
PHP2 <-- Filesystem: OK, done
Deactivate Filesystem
Browser <-- PHP2: Here's your content.
Deactivate PHP2
@enduml
{% endplantuml %}</figure>

OK, this might have been a bit long, but the point is that PHP 1 locks the session file so the second process (PHP 2)
has to wait for PHP 1 to finish processing the request and writing back the session data to the session file.

Now here's the interesting part, let's look at what happens in a cluster with a MongoDB session storage:

<figure>
{% plantuml %}
@startuml
actor Browser
control PHP1
control PHP2
database MongoDB
Browser -> PHP1: Hey, give me that resource please! PHPSESSID=asdfasdf
Activate PHP1
PHP1 -> MongoDB: Give me the data for sesson 'asdfasdf'
Activate MongoDB
PHP1 <-- MongoDB: Here you go
Deactivate MongoDB
Browser -> PHP2: Hey, give me that other resource please! PHPSESSID=asdfasdf
Activate PHP2
PHP2 -> MongoDB: Give me the data for session 'asdfasdf'
Activate MongoDB
PHP2 <-- MongoDB: Here you go
Deactivate MongoDB
... Both PHP 1 and PHP 2 do their thing ...
PHP1 -> MongoDB: Write session data for 'asdfasdf'
Activate MongoDB
PHP1 <-- MongoDB: OK, done
Deactivate MongoDB
Browser <-- PHP1: Here's your content.
Deactivate PHP1
PHP2 -> MongoDB: Write session data for 'asdfasdf'
Activate MongoDB
PHP2 <-- MongoDB: Here you go
note right: PHP2 is now overwriting any changes PHP1 may have made.
Deactivate MongoDB
Browser <-- PHP2: Here's your content.
Deactivate PHP2
@enduml
{% endplantuml %}
</figure>

The thing is, while **the file session backend locks the session, all other backends don't.** This means that
when *two parallel requests* happen, they **can and will overwrite each others changes** to the session data.

This isn't huge problem as long as you only store the current users ID in the session, but again, the session tends to
*organically grow*, and that's putting it mildly. The more changes you make to a session, the greater the risk becomes
that there will be a race condition. And double requests **do** happen, even if you don't do AJAX. Think of double
clicks on submit buttons, or even your non-existent `favicon.ico` request could land on your PHP script.

## Hacks and workarounds

OK, granted, there are some workarounds. You can use `SELECT... FOR UPDATE` in MySQL to lock a session (if you don't
plan to scale) or you could use so-called [spinlocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinlock) with timeouts. You could
even put a network filesystem under your sessions if you like getting up at 2 AM to an outage. But let's face it, these
are hacks more than anything. In a world where you have a fully blown application running in the browser, allowing one
request in parallel just *isn't cool any more*.

## Lower the granularity of locks

The biggest problem with PHP's session handling is that it gives you a false sense of security. It *pretends* that locks
are a part of the session as a contract in the dev environment, but they really aren't. And sessions without locks are
just an accident waiting to happen, especially the way PHP does them where it is incredibly easy to just store any
crap in them.

Later on, when you discover that sessions are biting you in the behind, there is no easy way to get rid of them. Your
application code probably just knows about one giant session object where it can store stuff in, it doesn't know
how to handle a segmented data storage that you could lock separately. Nah, you need to **rewrite your whole
application**. Ok, maybe not the whole, but a significant chunk of it.

So, in order to avoid this disaster, you need to **lower the lock granularity**. This means that you need to lock
only what you need. How do you do that? Well, you have a database, right? So if you want to store credentials, you
can give them a table. Say, create one table like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE access (
  id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
  expires DATETIME,
  INDEX i_user_id(user_id),
  CONSTRAINT fk_access_user_id
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id)
    REFERENCES user(id)
    ON UPDATE CASCADE
    ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

Now, what you do is you send the user the access ID in a cookie and whenever a user comes back, you can just look it up.
Do you need locks on this? Nope, not really, since you only create it once, then update the expiry time and finally
delete it when needed. Totally safe.

Next up, shopping cart. This one is interesting, because if the user clicks around like crazy, strange things can
happen. So to avoid confusion, you can use *transactions* for your updates, and then always send back the current
state of the shopping cart:

```sql
START TRANSACTION;

DELETE FROM
  cart_items
WHERE
  card_id=?
  AND
  card_item_id=?;

SELECT 
  *
FROM
  cart_items
WHERE
  cart_id=?
  
COMMIT;
```

See? Again, no locks needed, just make sure the user always sees the latest state and doesn't get a mismatching update.

And so on, so forth. Yes, I'm vastly oversimplifying things, but you don't *need* a session to store all your user
state. Besides, dropping the session as a state storage also has some neat advantages, like being able to share your
cart between the desktop and mobile device, etc.

And if you really don't want to access the database all the time, well, you can still store a lot of stuff in cookies
and local storage. Just be sure to keep the security aspect in mind.

## It's not just PHP

Having one giant blob of data for a user on the server side is by no means just a PHP problem. However, PHP makes it
particularly easy to shoot yourself in the foot. Sessions as a means of storing state are a liability in the era of
client side applications. They may work for small webshops, but they are more trouble than they are worth, and I found
that dropping the concept of sessions made my code a lot cleaner.

*Can* you build highly scalable sessions with distributed locking? Sure, but I hope your sysadmin likes running a
[Zookeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/) cluster for you.
